# AIPI 590 - XAI | Assignment #04

This assignment will cover interpretable models with the imodels python library, specifically RuleFit, FIGS, and HSTree methods. The notebook covers demos of these techniques with a credit dataset from OpenML followed by visualizations of these algorithms.

RuleFit - the generation of decision rules with associated coefficients from a tree based method for high interpretability.
